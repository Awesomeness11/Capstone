I plan on making an open world RPG game. The world will be a low poly world, both to account for my lack of experience with 3d-modeling, and to have a semi-unique style. There will be a unique way of fighting, in which you can hold the shift key to lock your character’s feet, and then the WASD keys will let you lean rather than step. You can use spells, in which you have to go through a small osu-like cutscene, with mastery after enough casts, allowing you to insta-cast without drawing them. You can melee attack by going into a ‘bullet time’ and swiping your mouse in the direction that you want your sword to go. There will be a lot of unique items and setting-specific attacks. There will also be some procedurally generated dungeons, made using tilemaps and linking of any possible tiles. There will be some cool bosses with very different attacks and ways of defeating them. This product will have a semi-decent value in the marketplace; video games sell quickly, and people yearn to find new game mechanics. It does not fill a NEED that people have in their lives, but it is something that a decent chunk of people would pay for. Once completed, it should be fairly economically successful, as the only work I would have to do then are updates and maintenance.
