The greatest challenge has been that hitboxes are a very strange thing and will sometimes collide with themselves or only certain layers
and it has halted progress. Had I been able to solve the hitboxes when the issue arrived, I would likely have my enemy complete, as well
as some of the game loop. My next step in the game after making the enemy would have been to implement the fireball boosting the player
upon the explosion, allowing for a fireball jump. I was disappointed that I wasn't able to get the hitboxes to work, else that would
have been much easier.
